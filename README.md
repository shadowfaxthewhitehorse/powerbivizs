# INFORMATION ON (MANY OF) THE UPLOAD SERIES'ES IN THIS REPO
#
A series or "uploaded series" in this repo  is a set of uploads with the same prefix. (These codes are internally used by projects I am working on.)

Please view the JPG and other image files to see the visualizations prepared.
Please note that the HTML files may not render properly since other files needed for rendering have not been provided. These files have been provided 
here since they are the output of many of the programs. You would have to run the code to see the actual HTML result.
#
#
Note that folders have been created for some of the series. Please refer to both the root directory as well as the folder to get all the 
files for a particular series. 

Most of the dashboards were used for a company's education offering (the company's offering was MOOCs to teach tech skills.)
